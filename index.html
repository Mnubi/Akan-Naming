        <h1>Akan <em>"Day"</em> Names</h1>
        <p>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
            Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.
            These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names.
            As a matter of fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names.
